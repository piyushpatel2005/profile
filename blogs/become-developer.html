          <h1 class="text-center">What you need to Become a Web Designer</h1>
          <p>Web development has progressed at an enormous rate in the last few years. It has been so rapid that no individual can keep up with the evolution of the technologies. There are so many skills to learn, so many frameworks and libraries that it will take a very long time to master all of them. Even worse! The major problem is that the time you master a framework or library, it will be outdated. The usual lifetime of a framework is around 5 years. jQuery has been around for fairly long time, but recently there have been so many JavaScript libraries and frameworks.</p>
          <h2 >So, what do you need to learn then?</h2  >
          <p>First of all, Learn the basics!</p>
          <p>Learn HTML and CSS. By the way, when I say HTML, it is the latest version of HTML, which is HTML5 with it's syntatic tags and their meanings. W3C has provided so many new tags to address the div cloud. In the past, developers used only spans and divs to design their layout. However, these tags don't have any specific meaning. Therefore, in HTML5 new tags with meaning were added.</p>
          <h3>Why is it necessary to use new HTML5 symantic tags?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
          <img src="../img/HTML5-logo.svg" alt="HTML5 semantic tags" class="img-thumbnail  img-responsive center-block">
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-push-2">
          <p>Because, they are the future! You know that the Web is controlled by an organization known as W3C. They make these semantic tags and browser developers should most likely conform to them. If they do not, they might fall behind in the competition, just like Internet Explorer has fallen behind in the race. This makes your website future-proof and your website will work perfectly for long long times.</p>
          <p>Another most important reason is that these semantic tags make your webpage more markettable. Probably, you know by now that search engines, like Google, continously crawl your web content and separate them in small chunks of data and whenever a user types a search query, they search in these chunks of data. If you use semantic tags, these crawlers will identify the main purpose or the title of your webpage and show the relevant content to the user. They also have a responsibility to provide adequate and probably the most suitable content. So, they search with complex algorithms to identify a text wrapped in a particular tag. If you simply use divs and spans which don't have any meaning, you will fall way behind other users.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, using simple and appropriate tags relieves you from the major burden of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) or SEM. Although, SEO involves many other tricks, using semantic meaningful tags is the first major step towards achieving desired result from the SEO service.</p>
          <h2>Ultimate conclusion</h2>
          <p class="lead">Always, always ensure that you're using HTML5 semantic tags and by no means use the deprecated tags which have been removed in the latest release of HTML</p>
